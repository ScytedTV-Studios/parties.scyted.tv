As a reminder for people who haven't participated in ARGs before (even if this isn't one lol) there's some Etiquette that needs to be established:

| **1** | **Never share private info** |
| **2** | Stick to publicly available Info |
| **3** | Do not call/email/mail private business or individuals, unless confirmed 100% to be part of the ARG |
| **4** | Assume whatever you found isn't part of the ARG unless you have solid evidence otherwise |
| **5** | Don't be a dick to people or organizations |

| **The following groups, Discords, people, etc. are confirmed to not be involved in this. Please do not contact/annoy them!** |
