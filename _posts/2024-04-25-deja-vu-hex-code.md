### Theories
- (From Discord user ***Kiloku***): Color codes are Hexadecimal triplets. Each pair of digits goes from 00 to FF, which are equivalent to 0 and 255 in decimal notation. D2 converts to 210. 99 converts to 153. 99 converts to 61. Does 210 153 61 mean anything?
- (From Discord user ***the lizard king***): “idk if this is anything but i tried just converting each hex place to its corresponding decimal so d -> 13, 2 -> 2, 9 -> 9 and so on. and then just to throw everything at the wall i converted that to the alphabet with a simple a-> 1, b->2, c -> 3 to get mbiicm”
- The color code is sandwiched. Do we have any ideas on “DD” or “2993” ?
